> A Tampermonkey script that transforms every post by the mythical  user `linuxcu1` into a single legendary word: **guys/beyler**.

## ðŸ’¡ What is this?

On the Turkish Linux/Tech forum [Btt.Community](https://btt.community), one man stands above all â€” not for his technical mastery, but for a mysterious aura of chaos and confusion.

That man is `linuxcu1`.

![38ce76520e6f7415bf147e9e699e38d6db53f037](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbdf0ae9-f9ba-4b47-af9e-f721338ad268)


In honor of the countless threads derailed by his legendary one-liner questions and misunderstood rants, this userscript replaces all of his posts with the word:

> **beyler**

Because letâ€™s be honest... thatâ€™s probably what he was trying to say anyway.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Turns every `linuxcu1` message into `beyler`
- Works automatically as you browse the forum
- Perfect for improving your mental health
- 100% free of malformed questions

## ðŸ”§ Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension (Chrome/Firefox)
2. Click **"Create a new script"**
3. Paste the contents of `beyler.user.js` into the editor
4. Save and refresh [Btt.Community](https://btt.community)

## ðŸ§ª Why?

Some write shell scripts.  
Some write kernels.  
We wrote *this*.

## ðŸ™ƒ Bonus

You can customize the replacement word if you feel chaotic.  
For example: `"debian kuramadÄ±m ben ya"` or `"ÅŸu macin iconlarÄ± mÃ¼k ya"`.

**Disclaimer**:  
This is a harmless meme script made for fun. We love you `linuxcu1` â€” never change.
